# Lucky-Rook 🏰

Welcome to Lucky Rook! This is a real-time multiplayer chess game built with a client-server architecture. The client is built with React, while the server is powered by Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. This is a rebuild of my previous chess application, Chance Chess. Users can play chess with a deck of cards, introducing an element of chance to a game where chance is virtually non-existent.

### ♟️ Features

- **Real-time chess gameplay** between two players.
- Users can **create or join game rooms**.
- **Player roles** (White/Black) assigned upon joining a game room.
- **Chessboard synchronization** between players.

### 💻 Technologies Used

**Client:**  
  
- ⚛️ React  
- 🗄️ Redux Toolkit (for state management)  
- 🚦 React Router  
- 🔌 Socket.IO Client  
- ♟️ Chess.js (for game logic)  
- ♟️ React Chessboard (for the user interface of the chessboard)  

**Server:**

- 🟢 Node.js
- 🌐 Express
- 🔌 Socket.IO

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. CD to client and server to install dependencies
